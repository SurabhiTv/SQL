# SQL
The objective of this project was to explore and analyze COVID-19 data using SQL in Microsoft SQL server environment. The aim was to learn more about the COVID-19 pandemic's cases, deaths, vaccinations, and population percentages.

[] The COVID-19 data was imported into a SQL server, where it was divided into separate tables for deaths and vaccinations.
[] SQL queries were used to explore and analyze the data, answering questions about total cases compared to total deaths, the likelihood of dying from COVID-19 in various countries, total cases compared to the population, the percentage of the population affected by COVID-19, the countries with the highest infection rates, and death counts.
[] Created temporary tables and views to store and retrieve data for visualization and additional analysis.
